# Project experience

**SIS**: Project is a big data analytics platform with data analysis for ordinary users, Microsoft mvp, and Microsoft Azure products. Involves a large amount of platform data (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, GitHub, StackOverflow, Meetup, WordPress, HackerNews, Reddit, etc.). 
1. User behavior analysis, the establishment of user portraits, content analysis, user-by-platform data analysis. Merge related users. User network.
2. MVP related impact analysis, technical point analysis. For community contribution analysis, and so on.
3. Social network analysis, recommended system.
4. Product data analysis on a platform (e.g. azure in StackOverflow, github influence). Compare similar product analysis.
The whole is related to the display of front-office related data, background logical processing, database layer logical analysis, as well as spider related work, is a multi-technical point involved in the big data analysis platform.

**Tinct** is a distributed task orchestration system that combines reptiles with a wide range of data crawling tools.  The platforms involved are github, facebook, quora and many other platforms. 

**spider**:   A typical production consumer Pattern. Design three parts, 
1.	Various spider are targeted at different needs, such as pages, database docking, api calls, rest service calls, network access restrictions, security, and their own multithreaded scheduling, and so on.
2.	For different platforms there will be different analyzers to analyze, extract, and convert crawled content. Form a data flow
3.	Data from the Data Flow Center unified management analysis layer, persisting the data to different places. The current primary database, and then interacts with the database. For example, sub-tables, merged operations.
The entire process uses custom thread scheduling to localize the message queue to store intermediate information and reserve some interfaces for expansion. Examples include scheduling, message queues, and data center processing.


The **Tinct** principal part is a distributed task distribution system that forwards tasks to individual nodes for operation. 
Cluster management in master-slave mode,
1. Use the heart mechanism to record the state of the machine.  
2. Error correction.  
3. Task dispatch functionality.  
4. Dynamically execute code.  
5. Down machine recovery function

**Partner** is a comprehensive evaluation system oriented by data analysis,

1. Collect information about relevant partners,
2. Analyze the partner through various KPI related indicators.
3. Analyze by predicting future behavior.
4. Push related services.
5. Find new partners.


**Transight**  is a catering system. Mainly a bit of the catering system(pos machine and mobile phone), user management system, ordering system (background processing), price management, main store and sub-store information interaction, rights management.
