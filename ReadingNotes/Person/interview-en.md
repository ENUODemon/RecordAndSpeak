#  Vehicle Regulations Intelligent Monitoring Platform  

### Project Responsibilities  
- Developed a stable and efficient web crawler system using C# to collect regulatory texts, policy updates, and PDF attachments from major global vehicle regulatory agencies (e.g., NHTSA, EU Traffic Authority, etc.)  
- Responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the entire crawler module, ensuring data accuracy and timeliness  

### Technical Implementation  
- **Core Framework**: Built the crawler's foundational framework based on HttpClient  
- **Anti-Scraping Measures**:  
  - Implemented intelligent request interval control to comply with target websites' Robots.txt rules  
  - Designed an automatic retry strategy to handle the instability of government websites  
- **Content Extraction**:  
  - Used XPath to precisely locate regulatory content in HTML pages  
  - Developed a regex engine to extract key fields (e.g., regulation numbers, effective dates)  
- **Data Processing**:  
  - Designed a data cleaning pipeline to effectively remove webpage noise  
  - Stored processed structured data in a database  

### Project Achievements  
- Successfully established a data collection network covering 50+ authoritative websites  
- Achieved daily automated monitoring of regulatory updates  
- Provided high-quality data support for downstream analysis platforms
